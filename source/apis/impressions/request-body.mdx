## Add Multiple Bodies

Firecamp is all about easing developer's work. Hence, instead of creating two requests with different bodies. You can can just create one request with multiple bodies in Firecamp.

> For example: If you like to test your APIs error response with 200/500/302 error code, then instead of having 3 different requests. You can replicate the same response based on 3 request bodies in one request.

To add multiple bodies in your request, click the `+` icon on the right side of the `Body` tab and enter a name for the new `body` in the dialog box that opens. Press the `Enter` key to add the body when finished.
